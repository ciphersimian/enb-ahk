# Earth &amp; Beyond AutoHotKey Scripts

Based on scripts posted to the Earth & Beyond Emulator forums, e.g.:

* https://forum.enb-emulator.com/index.php?/topic/12050-ahk-and-multiboxing
* https://forum.enb-emulator.com/index.php?/topic/8349-running-multiple-clients-simultaneously-multiboxing

but these use [AutoHotKey v2 syntax](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/v2-changes.htm).
